        Welcome to Peconic Chronic ! We have been around for 20 years even
        though we are technically new. We use the General hydroponics line of
        nutrients at all phases of plant life. All plants are grown in a promix
        medium and we use a combination of 600 watt high pressure sodium bulbs
        and ceramic metal halide to keep the spectrum as close to the sun as
        possible. We are everyday smokers that want a safe product and a lot of
        variety and quality, this is our passion as well as our dream.
